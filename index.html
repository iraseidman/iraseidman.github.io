      <h1>Analysis Academy's Philosophy</h1>
    </center>

    <p>It's tough to find a school these days that meets all the criteria that it should - educates every child to their
      fullest potential, prepares students for their paths as adults, and creates well-rounded people/citizens all while
      creating community and keeping everyone safe and connected.
      <br>
      <br>
      The Analysis Academy is the answer to all of these issues - a small school in New York City that feeds off of
      students' natural curiosity to make a home for intellectual, social, physical, and emotional for all of our
      students. Founded by teachers and parents rather than technologists, our philosophy is:
    <ol>
      <li><b>Children are free as inspired by A.S. Niell’s work at Summerhill </b> - kids can choose what they want to
        take, when they show up, what they work on, etc… Depending on the student's choices we will just keep students
        and their families what type of diploma they will be on track to earn by graduation.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Students can learn best on their own</b> - every class is self-paced and run through videos, assignments,
        and exams through Khan Academy so kids can work asynchronously and at their own pace. Classes will meet on a
        schedule and if kids are ahead they can keep working independently or if they are behind they can work with a
        tutor until they are caught back up with the class.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Teachers are tutors who teach ALL students how to analyze their own mistakes and learn from them</b> -
        classes are not taught with a teacher in front of a room but rather kids working together or independently if
        they prefer and just meet with a teacher once a day if needed to help them with the skills they can not master
        on their own or in class.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>The pillars of our community are</b> - love first, we are democratically run where every member of the
        school has the
        same vote, and curiosity for all.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>No bells, ever.</b> </li>
    </ol>
