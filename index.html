      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p>It's tough to find a school these days that meets all the criteria that it should - educates every child to their
          fullest potential, prepares students for their paths as adults, and creates well-rounded people/citizens all while
          creating community and keeping everyone safe and connected.
          <br>
          <br>
          The Analysis Academy is the answer to all of these issues - a small school in New York City that feeds off of
          students' natural curiosity to make a home for intellectual, social, physical, and emotional for all of our
          students. Founded by teachers and parents rather than technologists, our philosophy is:
        <ol>
          <li><b>Children are free as inspired by A.S. Niell’s work at Summerhill </b> - kids thrive  most when they get to choose what they learn, do, explore, and how they want to live. While this freedom cannot be absolute, it can be pretty damned close with freedom to:
            <ul>
            <li><b>Back to basics </b> - all students are closely tracked for fundamental skills and meet with teachers every day or two to drill the skills that they need the most help with. As students nail the basics the focus shifts towards building students metacognitive awareness to develop the strengths needed to be true life-long learners.
              <br>
              <li><b>Take what they want, show up when they want, study what interests them, etc… </b> Depending on the student's choices we will just keep students and their families what type of diploma they will be on track to earn by graduation.</li>
          <li><b>Students can learn best at their own pace</b> - every class is self-paced and run through videos, assignments, and exams through Khan Academy so kids can work asynchronously and at their own speed. Classes will meet on a set schedule and if kids are ahead they can keep working independently or if they are behind they can work with a teacher until they are caught back up and ready to work with the class.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <li><b>The pillars of our community are</b> - love first, we are democratically run where every member of the school has the same vote, and curiosity for all.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>No bells, ever.</b> </li>
        </ol>
